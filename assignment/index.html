    <ul class="list">
      <li>I've worked as a portrait photographer full-time for over a decade. Although I specialized in documenting large events, some of my favorite sessions involved theatrical performers, animals, or body paint.</li>
      <li>My middle name is Woodstock, a name that I share with my only sibling, my twin brother. I have yet to meet another pair of twins who were born as far apart as we were - my brother is 30 minutes my senior. <em>(Yikes! Sorry, Mom!)</em></li>
      <li>I've had a fascination with mermaids since I was young. A favorite <em>mer-</em>mory was when I became a killer mermaid for a friend's photo session. My 8-year-old daughter has since adopted the same affinity for merfolk and adores swimming in her collection of colorful tails.</li>
